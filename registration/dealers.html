who has been designated as an Approved Dealer. In order to become an Approved Dealer and obtain a table
(Full or Half) in our Dealer Den, you must have completed the following steps and selection process. Please
read this section in full before applying!
</p><section id="dealers-becoming-a-dealer-step-1"><h2>Step 1: Apply</h2><ul><li>To begin the process of becoming an Approved Dealer, you must first complete and submit a Dealer
Application. All required information must be filled in completely and accurately. Optional
information is not required at this time, but may expedite our evaluation of your application and
may become required at a later date.</li><li>Only one application per dealer business/entity please!</li><li>If you plan to split a table with another dealer, both dealers must submit applications separately
and list who they plan to split with. Evaluation for shared tables will not begin till both
applications are submitted.</li><li>We may need to contact you in order to obtain additional information, so please make sure to check
your email you have provided as your contact regularly.</li><ul><li><b>NOTE:</b> If your application is found to be lacking any critical information for us to make a
decision, we will reach out to the above email. If you do not provide the requested information
before July 9th, your application will be discarded and you will not be notified of approval or
denial.</li></ul><li>The Dealer Application will be open until <b>11:59 PM on July 2nd, 2021</b>.</li><li>If you miss the Dealer Application, we will open a Dealer Waitlist Application after the above date.
Please see the <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-waitlist">Dealer Waitlist</a> section
below for additional information.</li><li>For more detailed information and answers to common questions on the application, please see the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-application-faq">Application FAQ</a> section below.
</li></ul></section><section id="dealers-becoming-a-dealer-step-2"><h2>Step 2: Selection and the NCAS Vendor Contract</h2><ul><li>You will be notified by <b>July 9th</b> whether your application has been approved or not via the
Contact Email you have provided.</li><ul><li>If you are not selected for a Dealer Position at this point, your application will be placed on
the Dealer Waitlist unless you indicate otherwise. For why we are operating a Dealer Waitlist
and why you may want to be placed on it, see the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-waitlist">Dealer Waitlist</a> section below.</li></ul><li>Upon being approved as a Dealer, you will receive an NCAS Vendor Contract.</li><ul><li>This contract must be filled out in full, signed, and sent back to our team no later than
<b>September 10th, 2021</b>. Failure to do so will release your Dealer Position to be filled from
the Dealer Waitlist.
</li></ul></ul></section><section id="dealers-becoming-a-dealer-step-3"><h2>Step 3: Registration</h2><ul><li>Once we have received and verified your completed NCAS Vendor Contract, we will send you a link and
instructions to our registration system which will allow you to register yourself, pay for your
table, and register any Dealer Assistants that you still need to obtain admission for.</li><li>We advise that at this point you also reserve your hotel room if you plan to do so.</li><li>Further information can be found in the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-registration">Dealer Registration Information</a>
section below.</li></ul><p>Once you have completed the steps above and received your registration confirmation, you are considered
an Approved Dealer for the Bewhiskered 2021 convention as long as the terms and conditions of the NCAS
Vendor Contract are met.</p><p>If you are interested in being a dealer, please fill out the
<a href="https://forms.gle/C3VVPQK4LN4oGqga8">Bewhiskered 2021 Dealer Application</a>.
If you have any questions while filling out the Dealer Application, please see the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-application-faq">Application FAQ</a> section below.

Please see the Dealer Waitlist Below.</b></p></div></div></section></section><section id="dealers-waitlist"><h1>Dealer Waitlist</h1><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><a class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-primary w-100" href="https://forms.gle/panrYNUevez9ZT236" target="_blank">BWS 2021 Dealer Waitlist Application
</a></div></div><p>Due to conditions with our venue, we have a potential opportunity for an expanded Dealer Den space.
Unfortunately we do not yet have confirmation on this space at the current time and so have a very limited
number of Dealer Positions available.</p><p>Owing to the above and the potential of Approved Dealers becoming unable to appear at the event, we are
instituting a Dealer Waitlist. This Dealer Waitlist will be automatic for dealers who are not selected from
the initial Application, unless otherwise requested, and those that utilize the Dealer Waitlist Application
after the main application has closed.</p><p>In the event that additional dealer positions are added, or a current Approved Dealer resigns their
position, Dealer Den staff will utilize the waitlist to select and approach new dealers. If selected you
will be starting on Step 2 of the above process with an NCAS Vendor Contract. You will have one month from
this notice, or until <b>October 8th</b> (whichever comes first), to complete, sign, and return the contract
as well as provide your NCDOR Certificate of Registration number. You will then have until pre-registration
closes on <b>October 21st</b> to complete your Dealer Registration and pay for your table.
</p></section><section id="dealers-application-faq"><h1>Application FAQ</h1><p>What if I see a Google Sign In page when I first open the application Link?</p><ul><li>This is expected! We are using Google Forms with a file submission option. Due to this a valid Google
account is required. If you do not have a Google account to use with this form, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:dealer-relations@bewhiskeredcon.org">Dealer-Relations@BewhiskeredCon.org</a>.</li><li><b>NOTE:</b> This email/account does not need to be associated with your business. A question on the form
itself will ask for your “Contact Email” where you should supply the email which you will receive all
notifications and communication regarding the application and your status as a potential Dealer.
</li></ul><p>What are the sizes of the Tables?</p><ul><li>Please see the <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-table-and-amenities">Dealer Den Table and Amenities</a> section.
</li></ul><p>What if I want to split a table?</p><ul><li>All dealers that want to split a table in our Dealer Den must arrange who they will split the table
with before applying. We apologize for this inconvenience but we are unable to offer a table-matchmaking
service this year.</li><li>Please select the “Half Table (Two Dealers)” option. When you click next you will be asked for the
business name or owner/representative legal name of the dealer you would like to share a table with.</li><li>Please note, your application will not be evaluated until both your application and the one for the
dealer you intend to share the table with are submitted. Your applications will be either approved or
denied together.
</li></ul><p>Why do you need my full legal name?</p><ul><li>In order to allow you to deal at our convention, we will be utilizing a contract to clearly state all
requirements of you as a dealer as well as what you can expect of us as the organization hosting your
business. In order to make this contract legal and binding, we will need your legal name as well as the
business entity name and permanent address.
</li></ul><p>Will the “Preferred Name” be my badge name?</p><ul><li>No. this is simply for what we will address you as in our communications with you regarding this
application and regarding your status as a potential dealer. You will be able to specify your badge name
during the Registration in Step 3 of the process in the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-becoming-a-dealer">Becoming a Dealer</a> section.</li><li>This same applies to the “Pronoun” question.
</li></ul><p>What do you mean by (registered) or “sole proprietorship” on the “Legal Business Name” question?</p><ul><li>In order to make sure our NCAS Vendor Contract is correctly set up, we need the name by which the state
or federal government will recognize your business due to our record keeping requirements.</li><li>When forming and registering a business entity with the government, you are required to provide a name
by which that entity will be recognized. This is the name that we require for our records with this
question.</li><li>If you have not registered your business as an entity separate from yourself (called "unincorporated"),
this is considered an unincorporated sole proprietorship and legally the business is formed under your
legal name. This is why we ask for an unincorporated sole proprietorship to provide the legal name of
its owner.</li><li>For more information on different business structures and how they work we suggest the following sites:</li><ul><li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses">https://www.irs.gov/businesses</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure">https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure</a></li></ul></ul><p>What is a “Public Business Name” or “Doing Business As”?</p><ul><li>Related to the Legal Business Name above, a registered "DBA" or “Doing Business As” registration, also
called an “assumed name,” is a name that your business may operate by or advertise as that differs from
your legal business name.</li><li>For our purposes, this field is used to specify what name you would want listed on our site, media
posts, and convention literature to refer to your business.
</li></ul><p>Should I use my home address for the “Business Address” question set?</p><ul><li>Possibly, this depends on how you’ve formed your business. The “Business Address” in this case is
whatever address you have used in registering your business with the state and federal government. It
should be whatever address you use for legal and regulatory mail.</li><li>If you are an unincorporated sole proprietorship, please use your primary mailing address.</li><li>Please make sure to include any supplementary address details such as unit number that may be required
to ensure mail reaches your business correctly.
</li></ul><p>What is an “NC DOR Certificate of Registration ID”? Why do you need it?</p><ul><li>An NCDOR Certificate of Registration is the document you must obtain in order to sell any taxable goods
or services within North Carolina. This certificate is obtained by using the NC Department of Revenue
online or mail system.</li><li>The Registration ID is not required at the time of application, but will be required no later than
<b>September 10th, 2021</b>.</li><li><b>NOTE:</b> A Social Security Number (SSN) is NOT an NCDOR Certificate of Registration ID. <b>DO NOT</b>
provide us your SSN.</li><li>For more information on this and other Tax questions, please see the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-tax-info">Tax Information</a> section.
</li></ul><p>What is the Public Listing?</p><ul><li>This is your description of your business that will be used to publicly list your business on our
website, media posts, and convention literature.</li><li>Due to limitations on these mediums we have limited the entry to a maximum of 280 characters and reserve
the right to edit it as needed to best fit those needs.</li><li>Imagine this was a single twitter post you’re allowed to make to advertise your business. Similar to
that, carriage returns (or a new line) do count against this limit.
</li></ul><p>How does that differ from the “Detailed Product Offering”?</p><ul><li>The “Detailed Product Offering” is your typed description of what your business will be displaying and
selling at our convention if approved. Please be as detailed as possible!</li><li>Yes you can provide links to your products online, or photos of them here. Please note that if you have
a full photo of your table, use the following questions to submit that.</li><li>If you have any After Dark (AD), Adult, or “Adult Novelty” items you plan to sell, please include
details on them here.</li><li><b>NOTE:</b> This question is marked as Required as we do need a written description of what your business
is going to be offering for sale.
</li></ul><p>What is an “Example Table Display Link”? Do I need one?</p><ul><li>Use this section to link us to a photo of your table display that you’ve had at a previous/similar
event, or an example! This will be used to help us understand how you set up your table and display
your products to the attendees.</li><li>This is optional, but will have a large impact on our team’s ability to evaluate your application as a
dealer.</li><li>If you don't have these photos hosted online, that's OK. See the next question in order to upload them
directly to our form!
</li></ul><p>Do I have to upload files on the “Example Table Display Upload” question?</p><ul><li>No, as with the “Example Table Display Links” question above, this is an optional item. It is also an
alternative option to submitting links on that above question.</li><li>If you have photos to upload but have any difficulty with this upload feature, please email us at
<a href="mailto:dealer-relations@bewhiskeredcon.org">Dealer-Relations@BewhiskeredCon.org</a>.
</li></ul><p>What are Dealer Assistants?</p><ul><li>Dealer Assistants are any person whom you may need to make sure have access to the Dealer Den during the
setup/startup and takedown/shutdown phases of the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-schedule">Dealer Den Schedule</a>.</li><li>For more information on Dealer Assistants and how many each table type is allowed, please see the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-registration">Dealer Registration Information</a> section.
</li></ul><p>Does a room come with my Dealer registration? (“Hotel Room Preference” question)</p><ul><li>No. This question is so that our Venue Relations staff can ask the hotel to set aside a room of this
type in our hotel room block upon your application becoming approved. This will ensure that you should
be able to reserve the selected room type once you have completed this Dealer Registration process and
are sure you will be attending our convention as a dealer.</li><li>Unfortunately we cannot actually guarantee a room of this type will be available for reservation, or
that it will be granted upon check-in. This section is an effort to make your preferred accommodations
more likely.</li><li>In order to be sure you are able to reserve the room you prefer, we suggest actually booking it as soon
as you are able once the room block has opened.</li><li>For information on the convention hotel, please see the convention <a href="/hotel">Hotel</a> page.
</li></ul><p>Should I put my name as the “Hotel Room Reservation Contact”?</p><ul><li>This depends on if you will be the one booking your hotel room reservation. If there is another in your
party that will be doing this, please provide their legal name here so that our Venue team and the hotel
can match this application with your reservation.
</li></ul><p>Will I be guaranteed an Electrical connection if I check the box on the “Electrical Request” question?</p><ul><li>Unfortunately no, we cannot guarantee an electrical connection to your prospective dealer table.</li><li>Our team will do our best to see to these requests, but not all tables will have access to electrical.</li><li>An electrical connection in this case means one NEMA 5-15r receptacle providing ~115v AC. Each dealer
with this connection is limited to a maximum of 1 amp draw in order to protect against any circuit
failures.</li><li><b>NOTE:</b> An electrical connection may incur an additional fee determined by the venue and due before
the event begins.</li><li>For more details, please see the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-table-and-amenities">Dealer Den Table and Amenities</a>
section.
</li></ul><p>What else can I ask for in the “Other Requests” section?</p><ul><li>Anything! If you have a special need or a cool idea, please let us know!</li><li>This section is particularly important if you have a specific need for your dealer space that will
prevent you from being successful if not met. We’d rather be able to apologize early if we can’t meet
your need this year than have it come up during setup! If we cannot meet your need this year, we’ll also
be taking notes for improving our Dealer Den for next year.</li><li>As stated on the question, we cannot guarantee any requests in this section.
</li></ul><p>So I’ve submitted my application, what now?</p><ul><li>Thank you for applying! We’ll reach out to you via the contact email you’ve provided with any additional
questions or notices as needed.</li><ul><li><b>NOTE:</b> If your application is found to be lacking any critical information for us to make a
decision, we will reach out to the above email. If you do not provide the requested information
before July 9th, your application will be discarded and you will not be notified of approval or
denial.</li></ul><li>You will receive notification of your approval or denial on or before <b>July 9th</b>.</li><li>If your application has been denied, our communication will ask if you would like your application put
on the Dealer Waitlist. For more information please see the
<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#dealers-waitlist">Dealer Waitlist</a> section.

</p></section></section><section id="dealers-rules"><h1>Dealer Den Rules</h1><p>Dealers are required to know and follow the rules below in order to maintain their status as an Approved
Dealer for the Bewhiskered 2021 convention. It is the responsibility of the dealer to check this page
regularly for updates and changes.
</p><section id="dealers-rules-displays"><h2>Displays, Merchandise, and Services</h2><ol><li>Items offered for sale in the Dealer Den should be related to the theme of the convention or should
have a broad appeal to furries and others in attendance at Bewhiskered.</li><li>Items that are illegal to possess or sell in the United States, State of North Carolina, or City of
Durham (Firearms or restricted weapons, pornography involving minors, etc.) are prohibited in the
Dealer Den. Items that require a specific permit or license to display or sell shall require the
Dealer to present the license and are subject to approval by Dealer Den staff.</li><li>Depiction of real or fictional minors in adult situations is prohibited.</li><li>Any item that is prohibited for direct sale is also not permitted for display, giveaway, or delivery
during or after the convention unless otherwise specified.</li><li>The responsibility to ensure proper copyright of merchandise rests with the Dealer. North Carolina
Anthropomorphic Society, Inc. recommends Dealers research and are aware of the legality of
copyrights, trademarks, works of parody, and fan art. Please be aware that you will be required to
indemnify NCAS against any legal actions taken regarding the illegal sale of licensed products or
works that you do not hold proper right to sell as part of the NCAS Vendor Contract.</li><li>The dealer that has been approved and has signed the NCAS Vendor Contract is the only dealer allowed
to sell items from the table assigned. Do not sell goods on behalf of another at your table unless
those goods were described in your Dealer Application and you are collecting and remitting sales tax
for these items under your own business for tax purposes.</li><li>Dealer tables are non-transferable. If you have someone else who wants your table if you are
vacating it at the convention, direct them to the Dealer Den staff.</li><li>Non-firearm weaponry such as swords are acceptable provided these weapons do not have a sharp edge
and that the purchases are fully wrapped afterward. As per Convention Security Policy, these items
may not be waved or otherwise brandished in public. Any items which resemble firearms but are
non-firing must also be fully wrapped and not brandished. It is strongly suggested that dealers
urge customers who purchase such items to carry them directly to their hotel rooms.</li><ol><li><b>NOTE:</b> Attendees wishing to display their purchases despite the above urging must have the
items evaluated and peace bonded by convention security. Please advise them to keep the item
wrapped until they have been able to bring it to security for this process.</li></ol><li>Merchandise and products (including commissioned works) of an adult or sexual nature, or containing
such content are regulated by the following rules within the Dealer Den.</li><ol><li>Such items whose primary purpose is functional rather than artistic (such as novelty items,
personal care items, and toys) are prohibited at this time. As we encourage public health and
safety for its attendees, an exception is made for sale or giveaway of condoms and similar
prophylactics.</li><li>Artwork, clothing, or other items of an appropriate but adult nature may be sold only if they
are kept from public view. Such items must be covered or similarly shielded according to the
details below.</li><ol><li>Artwork containing adult material should be shielded (by Post-It notes, stickers, or a
similar covering that is not easily or accidentally removed), and should be kept in a
clearly-marked binder which must be kept closed by the dealer when it is not being viewed
by an adult customer.</li><ol><li>Binders or portfolios containing such artwork must be separate from other binders. A
tag or divider between "regular" and "adult" material is not sufficient. Any censoring
of artwork (pixelation, blurring, censorship bars) must be done to the satisfaction of
Dealers Room Staff.</li></ol><li>Items displaying content of an adult nature must be delivered to the customer in opaque
packaging that obscures the mature item completely, such as a bag, envelope, or folder. If
a customer has their own packaging that sufficiently obscures the items, they may place it
inside that instead.</li><ol><li>If the event rules or the <a href="/code-of-conduct/member">Member Code of Conduct</a>
explicitly allow specific clothing, masks, or accessories to be worn by attendees in
event space, those items may be exempt from this rule. Dealer Den staff have ultimate
say in regards to this exception.</li></ol></ol><li>Dealers are directly and fully responsible for ensuring that minors are not permitted to view,
handle, or be otherwise exposed to adult materials. Dealers who are found to be displaying
adult-oriented items in such a fashion that they can be viewed by underage members will be
afforded a single warning; further incidents may result in that dealer being removed from the
Dealers Room without refund and possible loss of Dealers Room privileges for future conventions.
Dealer Den staff have final say as to the suitability of wares for display or sale by dealers.</li><ol><li>Please note: The convention will provide a badge to each attendee with marking denoting 18+
or Minor. A sample of this will be available upon request to Dealer Den staff. Despite this
measure, if you are in doubt, you can and should ask your client for identification before
allowing them to view your restricted items.</li><li>In the event that an adult attendee is viewing adult nature items in your binder (as
mentioned above) and a minor approaches, we advise that you should request the adult
attendee to temporarily close the binder.</li></ol><li>Dealers should be aware that children, parents, venue employees, members of the press, and other
members of the public may be present in the Dealer Den during open hours. All signs, banners,
standing displays, etc. must, therefore, abide by a "PG" or better rating. Any display that may
be damaging to our community or NCAS’ public image is strictly forbidden.</li></ol><li>Any artwork, merchandise, or paraphernalia, whether for sale or free, that would violate any terms
of our <a href="/code-of-conduct/member">Member Code of Conduct</a> if worn or displayed is strictly
prohibited.</li><ol><li>In specific any of the above that features hate speech, hate group iconography, or espouses
violence, discrimination, or similar objectionable content is strictly prohibited.</li><li>Determining what qualifies as any of these restricted items is the sole discretion of Dealer Den
staff or convention leadership.</li></ol><li>By contract with our venue, all food and drink sales must be provided by Marriott at RTP and their
catering department. Therefore Dealer sales of food or drink are strictly prohibited.</li><li>Five Senses Rule: Your table's displays, merchandise, and staff should not annoy customers or other
dealers with sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. Specific concerns are bright flashing lights,
loudspeakers, and strong scents. Video soundtracks, CD previews, video games, and other audio need
to be kept at such a volume that they do not annoy customers or other dealers; headphones are
recommended if audio is a primary selling point of your business. The Dealer Den Staff have the
final authority on what does and what does not constitute an annoyance.</li><li>You are not required to be at your dealer table constantly during the open hours of the dealer den
schedule, however, Bewhiskered, our venue, and NCAS are not responsible for your items at the table
if left unattended.</li><ol><li>Note that leaving your table unattended or without merchandise for an extended period during the
Dealer Den open hours will be noted for future event vending application eligibility.</li><li>Further, if your table is left unattended and completely empty for more than two hours without
prior approval by Dealer Den staff, we will reclaim the table without refund to you and provide
it to another dealer at our discretion for the remainder of the event.</li></ol><li>No items may be produced or sold that bear the name “Bewhiskered,” the Bewhiskered logo, or any
other intellectual property that Bewhiskered or NCAS have created without due licensure from North
Carolina Anthropomorphic Society, Inc. (NCAS).</li><ol><li>Such a licensing agreement requires a licensing fee and pre-approval of the use of the
intellectual property on such items before they are produced. If you would like to obtain such
a license agreement, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:contact@ncanthrosociety.org">Contact@NCAnthroSociety.org</a> before designing or
producing such items.
</li></ol></ol></section><section id="dealers-rules-table"><h2>Dealer Table Equipment and Area</h2><ol><li>Damages to venue or convention equipment and property are the responsibility of the dealer assigned
to them or the area they occupy.</li><li>Do not move the table from its position that has been provided. Moving the table may present
hazards to emergency egress and is strictly prohibited.</li><li>Do not bring additional chairs into the dealer den or move chairs behind tables different from the

and prominently display their valid Certificate of Registration (obtained from the North Carolina
Department of Revenue) at their table.</li><li>The sale of manufactured or wholesale goods is restricted to Approved Dealers only on the convention
site, and must occur in the designated areas. Violation of this by any other member of the
convention will result in revocation of membership and possibly long term bans from future NCAS
events.</li><li>Sales, exchanges, and barter between dealers is welcomed. Taxes must still be collected and remitted
appropriately.</li><li>All sales must be accompanied by a receipt provided to the purchaser indicating the dealer business
name, items purchased, their prices and quantities, taxes collected, and total paid.</li><li>While all dealers must collect and remit sales tax, it is your choice whether to add this to the
sale total, or include it on the cost per item. If including on the item cost, you must clearly
display a statement that tax has been included in pricing. (NC Sales and Use Tax Bulletin,
January 1 2021: Section 2-1)</li><li>Dealers may accept payment in any manner they choose as long as sales tax is calculated and remitted
in US dollars. We recommend if you accept cash, that you bring plenty of change. Neither the
convention or the venue can make change for you.
</li></ol></section><section id="dealers-rules-admin"><h2>Admin</h2><ol><li>In any dispute regarding these rules, the operations of the dealer den, a dealer’s status and
ability to sell at the convention, or related matters regarding dealers, Dealer Den staff and
convention leadership have final say.</li><li>You may appeal a decision to a higher staff member if you feel it is necessary. As fair warning, the
higher the position an appeal goes for decision the busier the staff member usually is. The staff
member may not have time to review your issue until well after its immediacy has passed.
</li></ol></section><section id="dealers-rules-disclaimers"><h2>Disclaimers</h2><p>Bewhiskered, our venue, and North Carolina Anthropomorphic Society, Inc. are not responsible for the
security of or damages to your equipment and merchandise. Please take all necessary care to protect
against losses and damages as this is solely your responsibility.</p><p>NOTE: NCAS and convention staff are unable to promise to safeguard your merchandise and belongings at
your table. This is part of the purpose of having a Dealer Assistant, please make use of individuals
you trust in this role for such purposes.
</p></section></section><section id="dealers-registration"><h1>Dealer Registration Information</h1><p>Dealers registration and table fees are separated, but can be purchased and arranged in the same step,
along with adding Dealer Assistant registrations and upgrading any registration being made. Dealer and
Dealer Assistant registrations are the same price, tier options, and early discount structure as regular
registrations. They also follow the same cancellation and refund policies. (For details please refer to the
Registration page.) In the event that the Dealer or Dealer Assistants have already registered via the
regular <a href="/registration">Registration</a> page, we only need their legal names to attribute them as a
Dealer or Dealer Assistant before pre-registration has closed.</p><p>Dealers and Dealer Assistants are subject to the

are associated with.</p><p>In the event the convention sells out of normal admissions, we will guarantee you can still obtain
registration for yourself and your Dealer Assistants on the condition that you maintain your status as an
Approved Dealer according to the NCAS Vendor Contract.

to collect and remit sales tax to the NC Department of Revenue on all taxable items sold at Bewhiskered
2021.</p><p>In order to facilitate the above requirement, all dealers are required to obtain and display a Certificate
of Registration from the North Carolina Department of Revenue. (N.C. Gen. Stat. § 105-164.4(c)) This
certificate is not usually difficult to obtain and can be acquired online or by mail from the NCDOR
