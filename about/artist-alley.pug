      h1 Bewhiskered 2021: Artist Alley Rules and Policies

      p.
        The Artist Alley will operate as first come, first served until
        all tables are filled at which point a waitlist will be utilized.
        All tables are free, however there are many requirements and
        restrictions to their use and what kind of business can be conducted
        at them. The Artist Alley will be operated by the Dealer Relations
        staff out of the Con-Store. The below are the rules and policies
        that govern the use of the Artist Alley tables.

      p.
        All members that utilize a table in this area are considered an
        “Artist” according to the below and are held to the rules and
        policies found here. Ignorance of these rules, policies, and
        consequences is not a valid excuse and will not result in any
        leniency. Any violation of the below rules and policies will be
        handled according to the Penalties section below at the discretion
        of Dealer Relations staff.

      h2(id='artist-alley-rules') Rules

      ol(type='1')
        li.
          #[b MEMBERSHIP:] Artist Alley tables are restricted to use by
          current members in good standing. This basically means the artist
          must have a valid convention badge that was issued to them directly
          by the registration team and can be verified against their
          government issued photo ID and that has not been flagged by
          security as banned or restricted.

          Further, Dealers are not allowed to also hold an Artist Alley table.
          An exception is made for Dealer Assistants selling their own
          artworks and crafts pursuant to all rules found here.
        li.
          #[b SALES:] Sales are only permitted in the Artist Alley at a
          registered table by the Artist who’s signed-in.
        li.
          #[b SIGN IN:] Artists #[b must] sign in, to occupy space at the
          artists alley. In order to do this, go to the Con-Store which will
          have the Artist Alley sign-in.
        li.
          #[b TAXES:] Artists are required to comply with all state and
          federal tax law. Therefore #[b All] artists selling taxable goods
          will need a valid certificate of registration from the North
          Carolina Department of Revenue. It is the responsibility of the
          Artist to determine if their goods are taxable and to comply with
          tax regulations.

          IF an artist is selling taxable goods, they #[b must] obtain this
          certificate #[b before] the convention and display it prominently on
          the Artist Alley table as per NC General Statute § 66-255. They must
          also record the ID number from the certificate at the Artist sign-in.
          This number will be referred to as the NC DOR ID Number.
        li.
          #[b SIGN OUT and INSPECTION:] Artists #[b must] sign out of the
          alley when finished. Before signing out, please make sure to clear
          the section of all personal items and trash. Artists are responsible
          for anything left on, under, or behind their table section.

          After sign out, a table inspection may be made by staff to ensure
          it has been cleared off appropriately. A clean table is appreciated!
          Leaving a mess may result in being barred from the Artist Alley in
          the future.

          Failing to sign out properly will result in penalties.
        li.
          #[b ARTWORK and CRAFTS:] The purpose of the Artist Alley is to
          allow art and artists to flourish in our community. Therefore,
          artists #[b must] have the capability to, and be actively engaged
          in producing original artwork or crafts while using the artist
          alley.

          The sale of art prints and pre-made crafts is allowed within the
          Artist Alley, but is limited to those items made by the artist
          themselves. Sale of mass produced and wholesale items (otherwise
          known as merchandise) is strictly forbidden. Further details on
          what can and cannot be sold can be found in the “Rules Specific
          to Works” section.

          Content of such works and how they are displayed must follow the
          limitations and instructions within the “Ratings &amp; Minors”
          section.
        li.
          #[b ATTENDANCE:] Artists #[b must] be at their table in order to
          retain it. Artists may have up to fifteen minutes of break time
          to go get food, use the bathroom, or other such errands, but in
          order to retain the table they must be there consistently. Dealer
          Relations staff will be keeping an eye on this.

          Leaving the table unattended for longer, or having someone else sit
          in who’s badge does not match the sign-in sheet, without first
          alerting Dealer Relations staff may result in penalties.
        li.
          #[b TABLE SPACE:] Artists are allotted half of an Artist Alley
          table, making a usable space of approximately 48” (width) by 18”
          (depth) with a maximum height of 20” above the table surface.
          Please keep in mind that any displays that encroach on neighbors’
          spaces, or occupy any space in front, or beside the table, will
          be asked to be removed.

          Because of the limited space and for emergency egress, all items
          must be able to fit within this space on the table or under the
          table. There will be no space behind the artist, and the alleys
          and throughways must remain clear. Each of these spaces is
          allocated one chair behind the table. No additional chairs may be
          brought behind or beside the table. No additional attendees may
          sit behind or between the tables.

          Artists may display a banner or artwork over the front of their
          table, so long as it doesn’t interfere with attendee movement.

          No crafts or table displays may interfere with the prominent
          display of the NC DOR ID number.
        li.
          #[b ELECTRICAL:] The Artist Alley does not offer electrical
          connections. There may be outlets in the area, however Artists
          are not allowed to connect to them. As this could affect the
          relationship with our hotel or poses a risk to overloading
          circuits used elsewhere. For this reason, connecting to an
          outlet in the artist alley may result in severe penalties.

          A laminator will be available for use and laminating pouches
          will be for-sale at the Con-Store should an artist need one.
          Con staff will not be operating the laminator. Using the
          laminator is “#[b At your own risk.]” NCAS will not be held
          responsible for damaged artworks.
        li.
          #[b NOISE and LIGHTS:] Loud noise is prohibited in the artist
          alley. The artist alley is located in the main traveling halls
          of the convention. Music must be kept low enough that a normal
          volume conversation can be heard over it easily. We suggest use
          of headphones if you like to listen to music while working on art.

          Flashing light and distracting displays may not be used.

          Staff may issue a warning if we notice such distracting noise or
          lights, or receive a complaint. Repeated occurrences will result
          in penalties.

      h3 Rules Specific to Works

      p.
        Only works created by the artist present may be sold. The artist
        alley is not a free alternative to the Dealers Den. 

        Artworks and crafts do not have to be furry specific or adjacent.
        All types of artwork and handmade crafts are allowed. #[b However],
        this is a furry themed convention. If the artist has no furry
        related work offered for sale, staff reserves the right to terminate
        the artist’s possession of the table in favor of another artist who
        is selling works that will interest the convention attendees.

      ol(type='1')
        li.
          #[b ACCEPTABLE WORKS:] The artist alley is a free space, made so
          those new to the fandom can learn the ropes! Because of this, the
          type of works being sold in this space is narrow.
        ol(type='a')
          li.
            #[b Original artwork:] Artwork may be produced before, or
            during the convention by the artist sitting at the table. This
            includes sketchbook commissions.
          li.
            #[b Prints:] Prints of original work by the artist that the
            artist has printed themselves may be displayed and sold. Prints
            should be limited to two stacks or bins on the table at any time
            to reduce table clutter.
          li.
            #[b Small Hand Crafts:] Buttons, artist produced stickers, pins,
            small table swag, magnets and other small items that the Artist
            has made themselves.
          li.
            #[b Portfolios of work:] Portfolios of work are considered any
            medium which contains multiple artwork pieces for sale as a set.
            (Examples may be but are not limited to CDs, DVDs, Thumb Drives,
            etc…)

            These items are allowed to be sold only if the Portfolio is
            limited to works created by the artist AND has been produced by
            the artist themselves. The artist should only have two Portfolios
            displayed at any time to keep table clutter to a minimum. Keep in
            mind that all displayed artwork is subject to the terms of the
            Ratings &amp; Minors section.
        li.
          #[b NON-ACCEPTABLE WORKS:] The following are items which are
          restricted from being sold within the Artist Alley. Each exists on
          this list for good reason so exceptions may not be made. If you are
          interested in selling items that fall under this list, ask one of
          our staff about how to become a Dealer at future NCAS events.
        ol(type='a')
          li.
            #[b Fursuit and costuming parts:] This includes head, tails, paws,
            armor, parts, consumables, related accessories, and tools.
          li.
            #[b Consumables:] Food and drink may #[b NOT] be sold at the artist
            alley.
          li.
            #[b Merchandise:] Any commercially produced items including but not
            limited to: clothing, plushies, buttons, lanyards, patches,
            licenced stickers, mass produced stickers, and toys.
          li.
            #[b Official trademarked intellectual property:] While an artist
            may have obtained licensing to produce and sell intellectual
            property owned by someone else, such sales are limited to the
            Dealer Den. All works produced and sold by the artist must be
            created by that artist. In short: if a company holds the trademark
            or copyright to a work, it is not allowed to be sold.
          li.
            #[b Works and products which are too large for the allotted display area.]
      
      h3(id='artist-alley-ratings-and-minors') Ratings &amp; Minors

      p.
        The Artist Alley is located in a commonly accessible convention space.
        Because of this, all displayed artwork must be appropriate for public
        viewing. This includes crafted items as well. It is the artist's
        responsibility to make sure they are not soliciting nor selling any
        adult works to minors.

        Convention badges will clearly display MINOR. An example of this can
        be found at the Con-Store for dealer and artist reference.

        Any artist found to be selling adult themed artwork or crafts to a
        minor #[b will be] ejected from the convention.
        #[b This is not negotiable and cannot be appealed at the event where the ejection occurs.]
        Further the artist #[b will not] be allowed to vend at future NCAS
        events, and may be subject to a full membership ban to attend future
        events at the discretion of the NCAS board of directors.

        Artists must keep all adult works within a closed binder or similarly
        blocked from view when not being viewed by an adult. Additionally, all
        artwork within the binder or crafts behind cover must be censored. The
        exception to this policy is when adult artwork is actively being
        created. The responsibility for how to keep the work discreet is up to
        the artist but it must not be visible to any minor that may approach
        or pass the table. Be aware of who is at your table to prevent
        purposeful viewing of adult works by minors.

        Underaged artists must be accompanied by a parent/guardian at all
        times or have discussed things with the artist alley staff beforehand.

        #[b It is up to artist alley staff what is and isn’t allowed in the alley.]
        Please be aware that they may ask to remove artwork or crafts from the
        space, even if you may think it’s acceptable.

      h3(id='artist-alley-penalties-and-appeals') Penalties &amp; Appeals

      p.
        The Artist Alley staff reserves all rights of interpretation of these
        rules and policies. Penalties for breaking or failing to follow these
        rules and policies may result in penalties ranging from a warning all
        the way to ejection from the convention and a recommendation to the
        NCAS board of directors for a full membership ban. Most commonly staff
        will give warnings and make requests to alter what is featured at the
        table to comply with these rules, but may escalate to ejection from
        the Artist Alley at any time without obtaining further approval from
        convention leadership.

        In the event of an ejection from the Artist Alley, staff may also
        elect to block the artist from vending at future NCAS events.
        Staff will inform the artist at the time of the ejection from the
        Artist Alley in person or later via the email that was used by the
        Artist for convention registration. Such a block may be appealed by
        emailing
        #[a(href='mailto:Dealer-Relations@BewhiskeredCon.org') Dealer-Relations@BewhiskeredCon.org].
        (Please make sure to include all relevant details and evidence along
        with your badge information.)

        In the event of an ejection from the convention, notice and options
        for appeal will be communicated by security or leadership staff at the
        time of the ejection.

        In the event of a full membership ban, such details will be
        communicated via the email that was used by the Artist for convention
        registration and will include appeal options.

      p.
        If there are any questions you may contact
        #[a(href='mailto:Dealer-Relations@BewhiskeredCon.org') Dealer-Relations@BewhiskeredCon.org]
        and we will respond as quickly as possible.
