                Furs have gazed in wonder at the stars for as long as we can remember, ever since the very first of us
                thought to look up at the night sky and saw the stars twinkling back at them. For generations we have
                dreamed of setting sail on this new sea. The time has come to make that dream a reality. On 2021, join
                Commander Whisky and Flight Engineer Cassie as they prepare for the launch of a lifetime!

                The #[a(href='https://ncanthrosociety.com') NC Anthro Society (NCAS)] is proud to bring you Bewhiskered
                2021, a convention hosted by the furs of North Carolina for furs of all parts of the world. Located in
                the lovely Marriott at Research Triangle Park, Bewhiskered is in the heart of The Triangle and is just a
                few minutes drive away from the state’s capital and RDU airport.
            p.
                Our inaugural theme is “Blast Off” both for the convention’s official debut, and in honor of the 50th
                anniversary of Apollo 13. Join us as we hearken back to the retro futurism of the Apollo era and
                celebrate the start of an epic journey in the only way we know how: a three day weekend full of friends,
                entertainment, and much much more.
