        h1 NC Anthro Society Presents #[br] Bewhiskered: Prepare for Blast Off!
        p
            | Furs have gazed in wonder at the stars for as long as we can remember, ever since the very first of us
            | thought to look up at the night sky and saw the stars twinkling back at them. For generations we have
            | dreamed of setting sail on this new sea. The time has come to make that dream a reality. On 2021, join
            | Commander Whisky and Flight Engineer Cassie as they prepare for the launch of a lifetime!
        p
            | The #[a(href='https://ncanthrosociety.com') NC Anthro Society (NCAS)] is proud to bring you Bewhiskered
            | 2021, a convention hosted by the furs of North Carolina for furs of all parts of the world. Located in
            | the lovely Marriott at Research Triangle Park, Bewhiskered is in the heart of The Triangle and is just a
            | few minutes drive away from the state’s capital and RDU airport.
        p
            | Our inaugural theme is “Blast Off” both for the convention’s official debut, and in honor of the 50th
            | anniversary of Apollo 13. Join us as we hearken back to the retro futurism of the Apollo era and celebrate
            | the start of an epic journey in the only way we know how: a three day weekend full of friends,
            | entertainment, and much much more.
