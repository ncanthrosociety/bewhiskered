        h1 SAFE Haven for Cats

        p.
            We are proud to announce that SAFE Haven for Cats will be our partnered charity for 2021! Founded in 1994,
            SAFE Haven is a registered 501(c)3 dedicated to saving cats' lives. To date they have helped adopt over
            12,100 cats and spayed/neutered over 36,000 animals in their low-cost clinic. They rely on donations to do
            their incredible work, and we are excited to help them continue their mission.

        p.
            One reason we are so excited to work with SAFE Haven is their mission statement and core values. From
            their #[a(href='https://www.safehavenforcats.org/about-us/mission-vision-values/') website]:

        blockquote
            p.
                The mission of SAFE Haven for Cats is to use no-kill principles and education to save catsâ€™ lives
                through rescue, adoption, spay / neuter services and community programs.
            p.
                SAFE Haven for Cats Believes:
            ul
                li.
                    Every animal and human at SAFE Haven is an individual being with personality, feelings, intrinsic
                    worth and value. As such, they will be treated with respect and care in a non-judgmental, safe
                    environment.
                li.
                    We will always exist as a 501(c)(3) no-kill organization and strive to find homes for every
                    adoptable, treatable and recoverable cat we take.
                li.
                    Community volunteers are a vital part of our success and we acknowledge and celebrate their
                    contributions.
                li.
                    Affordable sterilization, community education and trap / neuter / vaccinate / return are proven
                    methods to stop euthanasia as a means of population control for companion animals.
                li.
                    We will not adopt out an animal before sterilization.
                li.
                    We will not euthanize an animal except in the case of illness, injury or other condition from which
                    they cannot recover, and then only by lethal injection.
                li.
                    Partnering, collaborating and advocating with other organizations and government agencies increases
                    our ability to benefit these animals and save lives.
